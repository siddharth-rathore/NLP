        "The prices of the stocks of companies listed under a global exchange are influenced by a variety of factors, with the company's financial performance, innovations and collaborations, and market sentiment being factors that play a significant role. News and media reports can rapidly affect investor perceptions and, consequently, stock prices in the highly competitive financial industry. With the sheer volume of news and opinions from a wide variety of sources, investors and financial analysts often struggle to stay updated and accurately interpret its impact on the market. As a result, investment firms need sophisticated tools to analyze market sentiment and integrate this information into their investment strategies."
