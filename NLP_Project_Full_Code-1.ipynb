        "The prices of the stocks of companies listed under a global exchange are influenced by a variety of factors, with the company's financial performance, innovations and collaborations, and market sentiment being factors that play a significant role. News and media reports can rapidly affect investor perceptions and, consequently, stock prices in the highly competitive financial industry. With the sheer volume of news and opinions from a wide variety of sources, investors and financial analysts often struggle to stay updated and accurately interpret its impact on the market. As a result, investment firms need sophisticated tools to analyze market sentiment and integrate this information into their investment strategies."

        "- The goal was to develop an AI-driven sentiment analysis system for stock-related news to assist investment strategies.\n",
        "- Several embedding + model combinations were tested:\n",
        "- Word2Vec models (LogReg, SVM): Weak performance with Macro F1 ~0.21.\n",
        "- GloVe embeddings: Improved results (F1 ~0.38–0.42).\n",
        "- Sentence Transformers (ST) with Logistic Regression/SVM: Achieved the best validation Macro F1 = 0.4603, indicating stronger contextual understanding.\n",
        "- Accuracy across models hovered around 0.42–0.49, showing moderate predictive ability but room for improvement.\n",
        "- Weekly-level summarization of news was suggested to enhance prediction accuracy for stock price movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recommendations for the Business\n",
        "\n",
        "- Current ST models already outperform Word2Vec/GloVe, showing the potential of transformer approaches.\n",
        "- Deploy a Real-Time Sentiment Dashboard: Integrate the best-performing model into a live monitoring system that provides:\n",
        "  - Sentiment tracking (weekly/monthly).\n",
        "  - Alerts for sudden sentiment shifts impacting specific stocks or sectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Business Impact:\n",
        "- Enables data-driven investment decisions by correlating sentiment with stock movement.\n",
        "- Reduces dependency on manual news scanning, improving analyst productivity\n",
        "- Positions the company as a tech-enabled financial advisor with AI-driven insights.\n",
